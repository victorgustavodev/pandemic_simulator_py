# Disease Spread Simulation

This project is a computational simulation of disease spread in a population using cellular automata. The visualization illustrates how individuals (represented as colored cells) interact over time and how a disease propagates through a population network.

## üìå Objectives

- Model the spread of a disease in a 2D population grid.
- Visually demonstrate the dynamic behavior of the disease.
- Explore the impact of different parameters: infection rate, recovery time, immunity, etc.

## üñºÔ∏è Example Output

Below is an example image generated by the simulation where:  
- **Red** = Infected  
- **Green** = Healthy  
- **Yellow** = Immune/Recovered  
- **Blue** = Dead (or other defined state, depending on the simulation logic)
